## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows a clean separation between backend and frontend:

### Backend – Spring Boot (`ems-backend`)
- `src/main/java/com/ems`
  - `controller` – REST API endpoints
  - `service` – Business logic
  - `repository` – JPA repositories
  - `model` – Entity and enum classes
  - `dto` – Data Transfer Objects
  - `config` – Security and application configuration
  - `exception` – Custom exception handling
- `src/main/resources`
  - `application.properties`
- `pom.xml` – Maven dependencies

### Frontend – React (`ems-frontend`)
- `src`
  - `components` – Reusable UI components
  - `pages`
    - `admin` – Admin-specific pages
    - `employee` – Employee-specific pages
  - `services` – API service layer (Axios)
  - `context` – Authentication and global state
  - `styles` – Global and component-level styles
- `package.json` – Frontend dependencies
- `vite.config.js` – Vite configuration


## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Backend (Spring Boot)

#### 🔹 Configure Database
Before running the backend, **update `application.properties`**:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ems_db
spring.datasource.username=YOUR_DB_USERNAME
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

server.port=9090
📌 Replace database name, username, and password as per your local setup.

🔹 Run Backend
Open Spring Tool Suite / IntelliJ

Import project:
=
File → Import → Maven → Existing Maven Project
Select ems-backend

Run as Spring Boot App

Backend will start at:

http://localhost:9090


### 2️⃣ Frontend (React)

#### Open terminal

cd ems-frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Frontend will start at:
http://localhost:5173

🔑 Default Login Credentials
👨‍💼 Admin (Auto-Created)
 
Email: admin@ems.com
Password: Admin@123
Admin account is automatically created on application startup.

👩‍💻 Employee Login
Employees are created by the Admin

Login credentials are generated during employee creation

Employees can log in using:


Email: (created by admin)
Password: (set by admin)
🔐 Security Implementation
JWT token generation & validation

Role-based access control

Protected REST APIs

Secure frontend route guarding

Admin safety checks (admin cannot be deleted)

📌 Future Enhancements
Forgot password functionality

Multiple admin creation

Search & pagination

Audit logs for employee actions

Email notifications

Docker & cloud deployment
